# xbinary

## Description

## Usage
xbinary is equipped with a makefile that allows you to generate a `.a` file.
To do so just type `make` in the root directory of the project.
The `.a` file will be dropped to the root of the project.
All you have to do now is to copy `include/xbinary.h` and `libxbinary.a` to your project and you are good to go. (I assume you know how to link it)
